s = "another big long string that has lots of characters"

Print a hash with keys for each vowel, where the item is the count of how many times that vowel is in the string

{
  "a" => 6, #???
  "e" => ....
}

Initialize h before looping over the string
h =
{
  "a" => 0,
  ...
}


BONUS SUPER HAPPY FUN TIME PROGRAMMING!!!
Initialize h = {}
