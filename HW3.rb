# Try again at HW2 Question 3 with loops, each_with_index and magic!

s = "A big long string up here. And another sentence y'all!"

# Print each word on a separate line
# Print each word in uppercase on a separate line
# Print the string with spaces replaced by "-"
# Count the number of words in the string
# Count puntucation marks in the string
# Break the string into an array of single words, and print it in sorted order (one per line)

### Find an array of the words that contain the letter "a"
# => ["A", "And", "another", "y'all"]
