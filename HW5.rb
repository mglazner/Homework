#HW5 assigned by JC
#Take one of your solns to HW4 and create it as a ruby file, and decompose it into #methods as you see fit. I would strongly recommend #starting small.

#Recall HW4
#vowels=["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
#s="another big long string that has lots of characters"
#h={}

#vowels.each do |m|
#h[m]=s.count(m)
#end
#=>["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
#puts h
#h={"a"=>5, "e"=>2, "i"=>2, "o"=>4, "u"=>0}


vowels=["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
s="another big long string that has lots of characters"
h={}
results=[]

#There were only 2 answers to HW4, and we did the other one as an example for last
#week's lecture...the only other answer I gave was fairly small formula, and it is 
#not going to lend itself well to lots of methods...
#Recall for understanding:
#
#using same variables as above
#
#vowels.each do |m|
# h[m]=s.count(m)
# end
#puts h
