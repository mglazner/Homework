# Update this program to keep a running tally of the same stats we were
# puts'ing in babylibrary v1.
#
# > A string here
# > Another string here
# > exit
#   A
#   string
#   here
#   Another
#   string
#   here
#
# EXTRA CREDIT! Rather than tallying up the strings, instead process each
# string and hold onto another form of data until the end, and print output
# from that.
