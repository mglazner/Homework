Loki: What have I to fear?
Tony Stark: The Avengers. It's what we call ourselves. Sorta like a team. Earth's Mightiest Heroes type thing.
Loki: Yes. I've met them
Tony Stark: Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction I'll give you that one. But let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demigod. A super soldier, living legend who kinda lives up to the legend. A man with breathtaking anger management issues. A couple of master assassins and YOU, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
Loki: That was the plan.
Tony Stark: Not a great plan.
