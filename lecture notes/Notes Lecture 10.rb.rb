Conditionals


If/then
else
You CAN string them together--

if, the condition to check,
  then, the action when "if"==true
end

elsif, can have multiples, is the second/third etc condition

else is the rest, you can only have one at the very end, if all else fails

unless is another conditional, the negation of if

case statements are slightly more compact ways of doing comparisons.("whens")
