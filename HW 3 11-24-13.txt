//I worked a LOT on the last and first questions: to rewrite the matrix rotation problem with 
loops, and to return an array of all the words containing the letter a, but reached no 
real solution. I really think I am just not getting loops. I mean, I think I understand
the basic logic of what loops are used for, and what they are doing, but I can't make
any work. Over and over again I would create a loop that would just return what the first line
asked for; .split or .each or .whatever, and never engage/output anything IN the loop.
I thought it was a variable issue, but even creating the variables OUTSIDE the loop, so that
they didn't disappear didn't really help.
We probably need to back up again and re-run the lecture on loops? Even Google failed me...
